# Prompting Strategies for Gemini

## Core Principles

### Clarity
- Be specific and direct
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Break down complex tasks
- Provide context when needed

### Structure
- Use consistent formatting
- Organize multi-part requests
- Include relevant examples
- Set clear expectations

### Context Management
- Provide necessary background
- Maintain conversation history
- Reference previous interactions
- Handle context length limits

## Effective Techniques

### Task Definition
```python
# Bad
"Write something about AI"

# Good
"Write a 300-word technical overview of large language models, focusing on their architecture, training process, and current limitations"
```

### Format Specification
```python
# Bad
"Give me a list of programming languages"

# Good
"List 5 popular programming languages in a markdown table with columns for: 
1. Language name
2. Primary use case
3. Key features"
```

### System Design
```python
# Bad
"Create an API"

# Good
"Design a RESTful API for a book management system. Include:
1. Endpoint definitions
2. Request/response formats
3. Authentication method
4. Error handling approach
Use OpenAPI/Swagger format for the specification"
```

## Advanced Strategies

### Temperature Control
- Higher (>0.7): More creative, varied outputs
- Lower (<0.3): More focused, deterministic
- Zero (0.0): Most consistent results

### Chain of Thought
1. Break down complex problems
2. Show intermediate steps
3. Guide logical progression
4. Validate each step

### Few-Shot Learning
```python
# Example format
"Convert these sentences to past tense:

Input: "I walk to the store"
Output: "I walked to the store"

Input: "She runs fast"
Output: "She ran fast"

Input: "They sing well"
Output: ..."
```

## Domain-Specific Tips

### Code Generation
- Specify language and version
- Include error handling requirements
- Define input/output formats
- Request comments and documentation

### Content Creation
- Define tone and style
- Specify target audience
- Set length requirements
- Include formatting preferences

### Data Analysis
- Specify data format
- Define analysis objectives
- Request visualization types
- Include statistical methods

## Common Pitfalls

### To Avoid
1. Vague instructions
2. Inconsistent formatting
3. Missing context
4. Ambiguous requirements
5. Overloading with information

### Best Practices
1. Test and iterate prompts
2. Monitor token usage
3. Implement error handling
4. Cache successful prompts
5. Document effective patterns

## Response Handling

### Validation
- Check output format
- Verify completeness
- Assess quality
- Test edge cases

### Refinement
- Iterate on responses
- Provide feedback
- Adjust parameters
- Fine-tune prompts

## Security Considerations

### Input Sanitization
- Validate user input
- Remove sensitive data
- Check for injections
- Monitor for abuse

### Output Filtering
- Review generated content
- Apply content filters
- Implement safety checks
- Monitor for harmful content

## Examples Repository

### Basic Examples
```python
# Classification
"Classify this email as SPAM or HAM: [email content]"

# Summarization
"Summarize this article in 3 bullet points: [article]"

# Translation
"Translate this text to Spanish, maintaining formal tone: [text]"
```

### Advanced Examples
```python
# Multi-step reasoning
"Solve this math problem step by step: [problem]"

# Code review
"Review this code for security issues and suggest improvements: [code]"

# Data extraction
"Extract key metrics from this report in JSON format: [report]"
```

Remember to regularly review and update your prompting strategies based on model updates and real-world performance.
