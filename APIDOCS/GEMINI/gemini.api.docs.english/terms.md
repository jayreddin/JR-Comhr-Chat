Effective April 3rd, 2025

To use [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview),
[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), and the other Google developer
services that reference these terms (collectively, the " **APIs**" or
" **Services**"), you must accept (1) the
[Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms)
(the " **API Terms**"), and (2) these Gemini API Additional Terms of Service (the
" **Additional Terms**"). Terms that are not defined in these Additional Terms
have the meanings given in the API Terms.

## Age Requirements

You must be 18 years of age or older to use the APIs. You also will not use the
Services as part of a website, application, or other service (collectively,
" **API Clients**") that is directed towards or is likely to be accessed by
individuals under the age of 18.

## Use Restrictions

You may only access the Services (or make API Clients available to users) within
an [available region](https://ai.google.dev/available_regions). You may use only Paid Services when
making API Clients available to users in the European Economic Area,
Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.

You may not use the Services to develop models that compete with the Services
(e.g., Gemini API or Google AI Studio). You also may not attempt to reverse
engineer, extract or replicate any component of the Services, including the
underlying data or models (e.g., parameter weights).

In addition to the
" [API Prohibitions](https://developers.google.com/terms#a_api_prohibitions)"
section in the API Terms, you must comply with our
[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy),
which provides additional details about appropriate conduct when using the
Services.

The Services include safety features to block harmful content, such as content
that violates our
[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy).
You may not attempt to bypass these protective measures or use content that
violates the API Terms or these Additional Terms. You should only lower
[safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_setting_gemini) if necessary and appropriate for
your use case. Applications with less restrictive safety settings may be subject
to Google's review and approval.

You may not use the Services in clinical practice, to provide medical advice, or
in any manner that is overseen by or requires clearance or approval from a
medical device regulatory agency.

## Use of Generated Content

Some of our Services allow you to generate original content. Google won't claim
ownership over that content. You acknowledge that Google may generate the same
or similar content for others and that we reserve all rights to do so.

As required by the API Terms, you'll comply with applicable law in using
generated content, which may require the provision of
[attribution](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1beta/CitationMetadata) to your users when returned as
part of an API call. Use discretion before relying on generated content,
including [code](https://g.co/legal/generative-code). You're responsible for
your use of generated content, and for the use of that content by anyone you
share it with.

## Unpaid Services

Any Services that are offered free
of charge like direct interactions with Google AI Studio or unpaid quota in
Gemini API are unpaid Services (the " **Unpaid Services**").

### How Google Uses Your Data

When you use Unpaid Services, including, for example, Google AI Studio and the
unpaid quota on Gemini API, Google uses the content you submit to the Services
and any generated responses to provide, improve, and develop Google products and
services and machine learning technologies, including Google's enterprise
features, products, and services, consistent with our
[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

To help with quality and improve our products, human reviewers may read,
annotate, and process your API input and output. Google takes steps to protect
your privacy as part of this process. This includes disconnecting this data from
your Google Account, API key, and Cloud project before reviewers see or annotate
it. **Do not submit sensitive, confidential, or personal information to the**
**Unpaid Services.**

The license you grant to Google under the
" [Submission of Content](https://developers.google.com/terms#b_submission_of_content)"
section in the API Terms also extends, to the extent required under applicable
law for our use, to any content (e.g., prompts, including associated system
instructions, cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents)
you submit to the Services and to any generated responses.

Google only uses content that you import or upload to our model tuning feature
for that express purpose. Tuning content may be retained in connection with your
tuned models for purposes of re-tuning when supported models change. When you
delete a tuned model, the related tuning content is also deleted.

If you're in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, the
terms under " [How Google uses Your Data](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#data-use-paid)" in
" [Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)" apply to all Services, including Google AI
Studio and unpaid quota in the Gemini API, even though they are offered free of
charge.

## Paid Services

When a Service is being offered for a fee, it is considered to be a paid Service
(the " **Paid Services**"). When you activate a [Cloud Billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts),
all use of Gemini API and Google AI Studio is a "Paid Service" with respect to
how Google Uses Your Data, even when using Services that are offered free of
charge, such as Google AI Studio and unpaid quota of Gemini API.

For Paid Services, "Google" as used in these
Terms has the meaning given
[here](https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity).

### How Google Uses Your Data

When you use Paid Services, including, for example, the paid quota of the Gemini
API, Google doesn't use your prompts (including associated system instructions,
cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents) or responses to
improve our products, and will process your prompts and responses in accordance
with the
[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).
For Paid Services, Google logs prompts and responses for a limited period of
time, solely for the purpose of detecting violations of the
[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy)
and any required legal or regulatory disclosures. This data may be stored
transiently or cached in any country in which Google or its agents maintain
facilities.

Other data we collect while providing the Paid Services to you, such as account
information and settings, billing history, direct communications and feedback,
and usage details (e.g., information about usage including token count per
prompt and response, operational status, safety filter triggers, software errors
and crash reports, authentication details, quality and performance metrics, and
other technical details necessary for Google to operate and maintain Services,
which may include device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens, and IP
addresses) remains subject to the
[Google Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms](https://business.safety.google/controllerterms/)
and
[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) referenced in the
API Terms.

When using Grounding with Google Search, additional data is collected and used,
as detailed in the
" [Grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#grounding-with-google-search)" section below.

### Payment Terms

Billing and payments for Paid Services are handled by
[Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts) in the Google
Cloud Platform.

As such, Section 2 (Payment Terms) and Section 14 (Miscellaneous) of the
[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms) govern
payments, invoicing, billing, payment disputes, and related issues, while these
Terms govern your use of the Paid Services. These Terms do not govern your
direct use of any Google Cloud Platform service (including those listed on the
[Google Cloud Platform Services Summary](https://cloud.google.com/terms/services)).

" **Fees**" (as used in the
[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)) for
Paid Services are as specified on our [pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) page. Google may make
changes to this pricing from time to time, effective 30 days after they are
posted unless otherwise specified (or in the case of new Paid Services, where
pricing takes effect immediately unless otherwise specified). Your continued
use of the Paid Services constitutes your consent to those changes.

## Grounding with Google Search​​

"Grounding with Google Search" is a Service that provides Grounded Results and
Search Suggestions and can be used through Google AI Studio (as an Unpaid
Service), and via Gemini API as a (Paid Service). "Grounded Results" mean
responses that Google generates using the prompt from the end user, contextual
information that you may provide (as applicable), and results from Google's
search engine. "Search Suggestions" (also known as Search Entry Points) mean
search suggestions that Google provides with the Grounded Results. If a Grounded
Result is clicked on, separate terms (not these terms) govern the destination
page. If a Search Suggestion is clicked on the
[Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) govern the
[google.com](http://google.com/) destination page. "Links" are any other means to
fetch web pages (including hyperlinks and URLs), which may be contained in a
Grounded Result or Search Suggestion. Links also include titles or labels
provided with those means to fetch web pages. Excluding your web domain(s), you
will not assert ownership rights in any intellectual property in Search
Suggestions or Links in Grounded Results.

### Use Restrictions

- You will only use Grounding with Google Search in an application that is owned
and operated by you and will only display the Grounded Results with the
associated Search Suggestion(s) to the end user who submitted the prompt.
- You will not, and will not allow your end user or any third party to, store
(except as provided below), cache, copy, frame, implement any click tracking,
Link-tracking or other monitoring of (except as provided below), syndicate,
resell, analyze, train on, or otherwise learn from Grounded Results or Search
Suggestions.
  - You may store the text of the Grounded Result(s) (excluding Links): (1) that
    were displayed by you for up to thirty (30) days only to evaluate and
    optimize the display of the Grounded Results in your application; and (2)
    in chat history of an end user of your application for up to six (6) months
    only for the purpose of allowing that end user to view their chat history.
  - You may monitor end user interactions with your application interface;
    however, you will not track whether those interactions were specifically
    with a given Search Suggestion or Grounded Result (in each case, in whole or
    in part, including any specific Link).
- Unless permitted by Google in writing, you: (1) will not modify, or
intersperse any other content with, the Grounded Results or Search
Suggestions; and (2) will not place any interstitial content between any Link
or Search Suggestions and the associated destination page, redirect end users
away from the destination pages, or minimize, remove, or otherwise inhibit the
full and complete display of any destination page.

### Data Collection and How Google Uses Your Data

In addition to the general terms above ("How Google Uses Your Data" under
" [Unpaid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#unpaid-services)" and " [Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)"),
when using Grounding with Google Search,
Google will store prompts, contextual information that you may provide, and
output for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating Grounded Results and
Search Suggestions and the stored information can be used for debugging and
testing of systems that support Grounding with Google Search. When using
Grounding with Google Search via paid quota of Gemini API, this processing for
debugging and testing of systems is in accordance with the
[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).

This subsection "Grounding with Google Search" will survive termination of the
Agreement, as applicable.

The
[Client Application Guidelines](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10926790)
apply to your use of Grounding with Google Search. For purposes of the Client
Application Guidelines, your applications that are using Grounding with Google
Search are considered Approved Applications.

## **Disclaimers**

**The Services include experimental technology and may sometimes provide**
**inaccurate or offensive content that doesn't represent Google's views.**

**Use discretion before relying on, publishing, or otherwise using content**
**provided by the Services.**

**Don't rely on the Services for medical, legal, financial, or other**
**professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for**
**informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified**
**professional. Content does not constitute medical treatment or diagnosis.**
