# Use Google Search Suggestions

To use Grounding with Google Search, you must enable Google Search Suggestions, which help users find search results corresponding to a grounded response.

Specifically, you need to display the search queries that are included in the grounded response's metadata. The response includes:

- `content`: LLM generated response
- `webSearchQueries`: The queries to be used for Google Search Suggestions

For example, in the following code snippet, Gemini responds to a search-grounded prompt which is asking about a type of tropical plant.

```json
"predictions": [
  {
    "content": "Monstera is a type of vine that thrives in bright indirect lightâ€¦",
    "groundingMetadata": {
      "webSearchQueries": ["What's a monstera?"],
    }
  }
]
```

## Requirements for Google Search Suggestions

**Do**:

- Display the Search Suggestion exactly as provided without any modifications while complying with the Display Requirements.
- Take users directly to the Google Search results page (SRP) when they interact with the Search Suggestion.

**Don't**:

- Include any interstitial screens or additional steps between the user's tap and the display of the SRP.
- Display any other search results or suggestions alongside the Search Suggestion or associated grounded LLM response.

### Display requirements

- Display the Search Suggestion exactly as provided and don't make any modifications to colors, fonts, or appearance. 
- Whenever a grounded response is shown, its corresponding Google Search Suggestion should remain visible.
- Branding: You must strictly follow [Google's Guidelines for Third Party Use of Google Brand Features](https://about.google/brand-resource-center/).
- Google Search Suggestions should be at minimum the full width of the grounded response.

### Behavior on tap

When a user taps the chip, they are taken directly to a Google Search results page (SRP) for the search term displayed in the chip. The SRP can open either within your in-app browser or in a separate browser app. It's important to not minimize, remove, or obstruct the SRP's display in any way.

## Code to implement a Google Search Suggestion

When you use the API to ground a response to search, the model response provides compliant HTML and CSS styling in the `renderedContent` field which you implement to display Search Suggestions in your application. To see an example of the API response, see the response section in [Grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding).
