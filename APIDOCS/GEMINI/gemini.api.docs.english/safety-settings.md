# Safety Settings in Gemini

## Overview

Safety settings help ensure responsible AI usage by filtering potentially harmful or inappropriate content. These settings can be configured at different levels and for different content categories.

## Safety Categories

### Harassment
- Controls content related to bullying, threats, or hostile behavior
- Adjustable thresholds for different use cases
- Default setting: BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE

### Hate Speech
- Filters content expressing hatred or bias
- Includes discrimination and extremist content
- Default setting: BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE

### Sexually Explicit
- Controls adult or explicit sexual content
- Adjustable for different audience needs
- Default setting: BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE

### Dangerous Content
- Filters harmful instructions or guidance
- Includes violence and illegal activities
- Default setting: BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE

## Configuration Levels

### BLOCK_NONE
- No content filtering
- Use with caution
- Requires explicit opt-in
- Not recommended for public applications

### BLOCK_LOW
- Minimal filtering
- Blocks extreme content
- Suitable for mature audiences
- Requires careful consideration

### BLOCK_MEDIUM
- Moderate filtering
- Blocks inappropriate content
- Recommended for general use
- Balance between safety and utility

### BLOCK_HIGH
- Strict filtering
- Most conservative setting
- Suitable for sensitive contexts
- May over-filter some content

## Implementation

### Python Example
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

safety_settings = {
    "HARASSMENT": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE",
    "HATE_SPEECH": "BLOCK_HIGH",
    "SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT": "BLOCK_HIGH",
    "DANGEROUS_CONTENT": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"
}

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro', safety_settings=safety_settings)
```

### REST API Example
```json
{
  "safetySettings": [
    {
      "category": "HARASSMENT",
      "threshold": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"
    },
    {
      "category": "HATE_SPEECH",
      "threshold": "BLOCK_HIGH"
    }
  ]
}
```
