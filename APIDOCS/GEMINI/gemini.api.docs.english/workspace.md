# Access Google AI Studio with your Workspace account

All [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) users have access to AI Studio by default. If you're a Workspace user and you want to get started with AI Studio, check out the [AI Studio quickstart](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/ai-studio-quickstart).

## Troubleshooting

If access to AI Studio is disabled for your Google Workspace account, you might see an error like the following:

`We are sorry, but you do not have access to Google AI Studio. Please contact your Organization Administrator for access.`

If you think you should have access to AI Studio, contact your Workspace administrator.

## Enable AI Studio for Workspace users

As a Google Workspace administrator, you can control who uses AI Studio:

- AI Studio is turned on by default for all editions.
- You can turn AI Studio off or on for sets of users across or within organizational units.
- Google Workspace for Education editions: Users under the age of 18 are restricted from using AI Studio with their Google Workspace for Education accounts. This is true even when the AI Studio setting is on. For details, go to [Control access to Google services by age](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10651918).

To enable or disable AI Studio for users in your organization, see [Turn Google AI Studio on or off for users](https://support.google.com/a/answer/15004095).
