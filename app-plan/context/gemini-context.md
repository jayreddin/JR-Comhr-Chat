# Gemini API Context

## Overview
Gemini is Google's advanced AI model family offering multimodal capabilities including text, image, video, and audio processing.

## Key Model Variants
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview**: Optimized for adaptive thinking and cost efficiency
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview**: Enhanced thinking, reasoning, and multimodal understanding
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Fast, versatile model with experimental image generation
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro**: Complex reasoning tasks
- **Specialized Models**: Including Embedding, Imagen 3 (images), Veo 2 (video)

## Technical Specifications
- Maximum input tokens: 1,048,576 (2.5 series)
- Output tokens: Up to 65,536
- Token ratio: ~4 characters per token
- Language support: 43 languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Spanish

## Core Features
1. **Text Generation**
   - Basic text completion
   - Multi-turn conversations
   - Streaming responses
   - System instructions support

2. **Multimodal Capabilities**
   - Image input/understanding
   - Video processing
   - Audio processing
   - Text-to-image generation (experimental)

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Code execution
   - Function calling
   - Search grounding
   - Structured outputs
   - Caching support

## API Integration
```python
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")

# Basic text generation
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents=["Your prompt here"]
)

# Chat functionality
chat = client.chats.create(model="gemini-2.0-flash")
response = chat.send_message("Your message")

# Streaming support
response = client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents=["Your prompt"]
)
```

## Configuration Options
- Temperature (0.0-2.0)
- Maximum output tokens
- Stop sequences
- Top-p and Top-k sampling
- System instructions

## Best Practices
- Use system instructions for consistent behavior
- Consider streaming for faster interactions
- Leverage chat format for multi-turn conversations
- Adjust temperature based on desired creativity vs determinism
- Choose appropriate model variant based on use case

## Limitations & Considerations
- Token limits vary by model
- Knowledge cutoff dates vary (latest: January 2025)
- Some features are experimental or in preview
- Model behavior can be controlled via system instructions
